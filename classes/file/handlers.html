			<p>
				Fuel allows you to wrap directories and files in objects. By doing this it allows you to access
				and modify filesystem items (files and directories) on a OO basis. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The objects received from the File class (or file area's) are <em>File Handlers</em>. Fuel
				has two core file handlers: <em>File Handler</em> and <em>Directory Handler</em>.
				Like you would expect these classes handle the files and directories.

				<h3>Usage</h3>
			
				<p>
					Every helper class comes with a set of methods that allow you to perform opperations on the
					files or directories wrapped inside the object. Here is are some examples using
					<a href="usage.html#method_get">File::get</a>:
				</p>
				
				<pre class="php"><code> // First we'll get a file
$file = \File::get(DOCROOT.'/here_is_my/textfile.txt');
</code></pre>
	
				<p>Now we've got the file handler, we can use it's methods to get something done.</p>
				
				<pre class="code"><code>// Let's rename rename it.
$file->rename('new_name');

// Get the file's content
$content = $file->read();

// And rename it back to the original name
$file->rename('textfile');
</code></pre>
				
				<p>
					As you can see in the example above, when renaming the file you don't need to refetch the handler.
					You can reuse the same object over and over, untill you delete the file or unset the var.
				</p>

				<h3 id="writing_handlers">Writing handlers</h3>
			
				<h4 id="writing_handlers_intro">Intoduction</h4>
				
				<p>
					As mentioned before Fuel comes with two predefined handlers. One for directories and one for
					files. By writing your own handlers you can alter the behaviour and add functionalities by
					filetype. For instance, when dealing with csv files you might want to auto-parse them when
					reading, or be able to fetch a image object from image files.
				</p>
				
				<h4 id="writing_handlers_how_to">How to write them...</h4>
				
				<p>
					Handlers are classes that extend the File Handler class (<strong>\File_Handler_File</strong>).
					Here is an example:
				</p>
				
				<pre class="php"><code>&lt;?php

class File_Handler_XML extends \File_Handler_File {

	public function get_simplexml()
	{
		return simplexml_load_file($this->path);
	}

}

/* End of file xml.php */
</code></pre>
		
				<p class="note">Note the <strong>$this->path</strong>. This will always hold the path to the current file, even when moving or renaming.</p>
				
				<h4 id="writing_handlers_adding">Adding them...</h4>
				
				<p>
					File handlers can be assigned by adding them in the file config.
					By adding them to the base config all files from a certain extension wil be fetched as the
					desired handler. You can also assign handlers on an area basis by adding them to the area config
					you'd like to use them in.
				</p>
				
				<pre class="php"><code>// In app/config/file.php

'base_config' => array(
	'file_handlers' => array(
		'csv' => 'File_Handler_Csv',
	),
),

'areas' => array(
	'my_area' => array(
		'xml' => 'File_Hanlder_XML',
	),
),
</code></pre>
